Logs all sent packets in Growtopia using GrowLauncher.  
Captured packets are written to `Packet.lua` as clean, executable commands.

## ✨ Features
- Logs `SendPacket` type and content via `OnSendPacket` hook
- Saves to `Packet.lua` as:
  ```lua
  SendPacket(type, "content")

## 📁 Output Example
```lua

local SendPacket = SendPacket or sendPacket

SendPacket(2, "action|dialog_return|dialog_name|mines_game|buttonClicked|mine_7_8")
SendPacket(3, "action|join_request|name|WorldName")
```
